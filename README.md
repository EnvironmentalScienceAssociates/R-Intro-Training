# Introduction to R for Excel Users

## Overview

This repo contains materials for internal training in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with an emphasis on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of packages, particularly [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), [tidyr](), and [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). The materials are targeted at people with no R experience. The focus of the materials is on data wrangling and visualization. The stucture of the materials follows the books, [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) and [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org). The goal is to provide training in efficient and reproducible workflows as an alternative to work that is typically done in Excel.
